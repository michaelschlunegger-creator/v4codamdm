### Sloane Hartwell — CEO / CFO
Company: HelioVista Energy
Role: Owns profitable growth and capital allocation.
Red path: Link duplicates to cash release, quantify the pilot impact, and secure an executive sponsor for the PoC.
Focus areas: Working capital locked in redundant stock; Visibility across sites and systems; Confidence to fund rapid pilots

#### Question 1
Recently, a CEO / CFO peer in Oil & Gas unlocked $10M by eliminating 10% duplicate stock tied to Working capital locked in redundant stock. A peer CEO unlocked $10M by exposing duplicate spares—how do you measure the cash tied up in spare parts and project materials today?

- Medium: Finance reconciles stock quarterly and adjusts reserves when counts look high.
  - Coaching: Quarterly reconciliation is slow; tie the lag to cash risk and propose a PoC that validates live data feeds.
- Optimal: We monitor a live dashboard that flags duplicates, so working capital stays visible.
  - Coaching: A live view means we can plug CODA into existing controls and prove incremental cash unlocks quickly.
- Unfavorable: Controllers rely on historical spend because material masters are inconsistent.
  - Coaching: Guesswork highlights the data gap. Position CODA as the fastest path to measurable, audit-ready visibility.

### Rafael McBride — Finance / CFO
Company: HelioVista Energy
Role: Safeguards liquidity, reporting accuracy, and governance.
Red path: Quantify leakage from misclassified spend, model the cash unlocked by cleansing, and propose a governance-led pilot.
Focus areas: Consolidated visibility across ERPs; Working-capital unlocks tied to data quality; Governance that stands up to audit

#### Question 1
Recently, a Finance / CFO peer in Oil & Gas unlocked $10M by eliminating 10% duplicate stock tied to Consolidated visibility across ERPs. After consolidating vendor data across refineries, how much visibility do you have into material stock and vendor spend across all sites?

- Optimal: Yes—we consolidate and trust the numbers.
  - Coaching: Great. CODA can validate that trusted view and surface hidden duplicates without disrupting reporting.
- Medium: Partially—we reconcile across a few ERPs, but it takes effort.
  - Coaching: Partial visibility is costly time. Offer CODA to standardize attributes and automate roll-ups.
- Unfavorable: Each site runs its own data, so consolidation is painful.
  - Coaching: Fragmentation screams risk. Use CODA to create a single, auditable baseline before the next close.

#### Question 2
How do you calculate the working capital you could release by cleansing duplicate or obsolete stock?

- Optimal: We model scenarios by category to see the cash impact quickly.
  - Coaching: Perfect fit. CODA can feed that model with real duplication rates to validate the release.
- Medium: We carry a rough estimate based on historical write-offs.
  - Coaching: A rough estimate is a starting point. Offer a data-backed assessment to sharpen the forecast.
- Unfavorable: We don’t calculate it—operations just carries the stock.
  - Coaching: No calculation means hidden cash. Frame CODA as the fastest way to prove and capture the upside.

#### Question 1
Recently, a CIO / Head of IT peer in Oil & Gas unlocked $10M by eliminating 10% duplicate stock tied to Cross-system master data flow. After a CMMS rollout flooded SAP with duplicates, how are you governing material masters across SAP, Maximo, and other CMMS instances?

- Optimal: Everything is governed centrally through SAP.
  - Coaching: Central governance is strong. CODA can plug in to enforce standards and block duplicates before they spread.
- Medium: We coordinate between SAP and Maximo but rely on people to keep them in sync.
  - Coaching: Human syncing creates drift. Offer CODA to automate cross-system checks and keep catalogs aligned.
- Unfavorable: Each site handles its own masters with little coordination.
  - Coaching: Decentralization breeds duplication. Use this to justify a controlled hub powered by CODA.

#### Question 1
Recently, a Operations / Maintenance Head peer in Oil & Gas unlocked $10M by eliminating 10% duplicate stock tied to First-time-right job execution. A maintenance leader avoided a shutdown by fixing item descriptions early—how do you keep crews confident the part they pick matches the work order?

- Medium: Supervisors rely on tribal knowledge and photos in chat groups to confirm parts.
  - Coaching: Tribal knowledge is fragile. CODA can capture that detail and standardize it across shifts.
- Optimal: We run a standardized catalog that enforces descriptions before anything is issued.
  - Coaching: Standardized catalogs pair perfectly with CODA's governed descriptions to keep jobs first-time-right.
- Unfavorable: Technicians swap parts if they look close enough and deal with issues later.
  - Coaching: Swapping parts risks safety and downtime. Position CODA as the guardrail that prevents mismatches.

#### Question 3
How do you decide the right safety stock when specs differ slightly across plants?

- Medium: We set conservative levels because we don’t fully trust the descriptions.
  - Coaching: Conservative stock is costly. CODA's deduplication can cut buffers without risking uptime.
- Optimal: We normalize specs and share one source of truth, so buffers stay lean.
  - Coaching: Lean buffers with shared specs aligns with CODA's normalization. Build on this to tighten turnarounds.
- Unfavorable: Each plant picks its own policy, and we revisit it every few years.
  - Coaching: Infrequent reviews hide risk. Offer CODA as a continuous guardrail for spec drift.

- Optimal: Include the master data systems that matter most with finance/operations owners in a weekly steerco.
  - Coaching: Strong plan—governed data and accountable sponsors keep the PoC credible and quick.

- Unfavorable: Keep it informal with minimal stakeholders to move fast and avoid red tape.
  - Coaching: Lightweight is risky. A PoC without the right data or owners will stall.
